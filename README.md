# data66_challenge

Inpired by gymshark66 challenge, (in which I choose to attend since March. 4th) , I'm challenging myself to spend a data 66 challenges since May.3rd.
The goal is to inspire me to consistently to read the [Machine Learning from Scratch](https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/introduction.html)



## GOALs

1. Document what I read in 66 days, and try not to find excuse to skip it.
2. The goal is to read the book ```Machine Learning from Scratch.```

### NOTE: 
It's not realistic to read one chapter a day, or read every day. 
Hence, we set the goal to record what you read each single day.
